		<td><font face="Garamond">It has been brought to my attention more than once that this 
		website is not easy to browse. I maintain that it is simply unusual, 
		charmingly and confusingly old fashioned. </font>
		<p><font face="Garamond">In response to a world that heavily relies on images to convey 
		messages,<b> nasovvv.org employs words</b>, and it does for a reason. 
		Such is its peculiarity.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">This choice comes at a price, though, that I am more than willing to 
		share with you, readers: I am shouldering the burden of conceiving and 
		developing the content, you, in return, are taking the time to enjoy it 
		in its entirety, without giving up immediately. In order to 
		enjoy it you shall need to stay focused, to follow links that 
		may be two or even three clicks away, to go back, to read thoroughly, 
		sometimes between the lines.&nbsp; </font> </p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">It should be made clear that my stance on illustration is not a 
		negative one altogether. Beauty is fundamental and <b>I strenuously 
		defend the effort of anyone working to please the eye</b>. Furthermore, the 
		advantages of a picture-based communication are innumerable: immediacy, 
		effectiveness, functionality, just to name a few.&nbsp; However, said communication seems to be sadly resulting 
		in an increasingly low attention span, a tendency to oversimplification, 
		a growing inability to express complex concepts. </font> </p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">This website is not perfect, it most 
		certainly contains mistakes and contradictions but it is my humble contribution to 
		the prevention of utter brain atrophy. I am, by means of this page, <b>reclaiming the power of language</b>. 
		</font> </p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">Let words be our tool and images our 
		good companion.</font></p>
