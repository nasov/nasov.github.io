		<font face="Garamond">Nasov hasn't always been ONLY Francesco. As a 
		matter of fact, it started as a duo, guitar and drums, in London in 
		2010. A duo that had little to do with the current sound of Nasov; it 
		was more a post punk formation with heavy influences from Fugazi, 
		Shellac etc. Either way, after a few months of that, a few bass players 
		joined in, some of whom are definitely worth mentioning:</font></p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">- Francesco Garau, already an established 
		musician with Le Fave Assassine;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">- Dewey Roskilly, youngest NOFX's Fat Mike's 
		lookalike;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">- Alexis Becker, great guy from Luxemburg, 
		sporting a remarkable quiff.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">In 2011 Jerome Burnet (a close up magician, 
		yes, really) became a steady member of the band. Gigs were played,
		<a target="_blank" href="https://nasov.bandcamp.com/album/nasov">songs 
		were recorded</a> and beers were drunk and that's about it.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">The thing is, Francesco had always had an 
		interest in quieter music, singer songwriters, solo artists. This is the 
		reason why - while still in the band - he started working on some of the 
		songs on his own, approaching them from a different angle, just acoustic 
		guitar and vocals. The rest followed rather naturally. When he left 
		London to go back to his home town, the old and new songs were already 
		well structured. Recording them was the next step and the outcome was 
		the album that is mentioned so frequently on this website: <i>Catch the 
		biggest fish in the ocean, then what?</i></font></p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">Influences incude Wilco, Ryan Adams, Elliot 
		Smith, M Ward, Feist, Damien Rice, Bon Iver, Villagers. He is not fond 
		of Jeff Buckley.</font></p>
