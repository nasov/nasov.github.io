# 🎵 nasovvv.org Website Repository

Welcome to the digital time capsule that is nasovvv.org! This repository contains the static HTML files that power [nasov.github.io](https://nasov.github.io/), a website proudly crafted in the ancient arts of Microsoft FrontPage.

## 🦕 About This Repository

This is a maintenance repository for nasovvv.org, a musician's website that deliberately chooses words over modern web conventions. As proclaimed in our [manifesto](public/mysite/manifesto.htm), we're "reclaiming the power of language" one `<font>` tag at a time.

## 📜 Technical Details

- **Platform**: Static HTML
- **Original Development Tool**: Microsoft FrontPage (yes, really!)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Mobile Optimization**: None (and proud of it!)
- **Best Viewed In**: Any browser that hasn't forgotten its HTML roots

## 🛠️ Maintenance Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Make your changes to the HTML files
3. Commit and push to main branch
4. GitHub Pages will automatically deploy the updates

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This site was built before smartphones were a thing, and we're keeping it that way
- We maintain the original FrontPage structure for historical accuracy
- Yes, we know about modern web development. No, we don't want it
- The `_vti_cnf` folders are FrontPage artifacts - leave them be

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

As stated in our manifesto:
> "In response to a world that heavily relies on images to convey messages, nasovvv.org employs words, and it does for a reason. Such is its peculiarity."

## 🤝 Contributing

Before making any changes, please remember:
1. Respect the existing HTML structure
2. Maintain the intentionally vintage aesthetic
3. When in doubt, add more words
